# My Professional Portfolio

This is a multi-page, responsive portfolio website built from scratch using HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript. It is designed to showcase my skills and projects as a web developer.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into a clean and intuitive folder structure to ensure maintainability and scalability.

- `/css`: Contains the `style.css` file for all styling and responsive design.
- `/js`: Contains the `script.js` file for all interactive elements, such as the mobile navigation toggle and form validation.
- `/images`: Stores all image assets used on the site.
- The root directory contains the main HTML files for each page: `index.html`, `about.html`, `projects.html`, and `contact.html`.

## Features

- **Multi-page Layout:** The site includes a Home, About, Projects, and Contact page.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive and adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes using CSS media queries.
- **Interactive Elements:**
    - A **mobile navigation menu** that toggles open and closed.
    - **Client-side form validation** on the Contact page.
